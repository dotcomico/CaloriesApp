Calorie Tracker (Android, Java)

A personal side project for tracking calories, built with Android Studio in Java.
This app is written in Hebrew and is currently under refactoring to improve code quality and structure.

ðŸ“Œ Project Status

The project started as a hobby more than 3 years ago, based mostly on my high school programming background.

The initial codebase was functional but not clean. Recently, I discovered the importance of clean code and good architecture, so I am now:

Splitting responsibilities into helper classes

Improving readability and maintainability

Making the code more professional

Once the refactoring is complete, I plan to:

Add new features

Redesign the UI/UX

Continue developing this as a long-term learning project


- Upcoming Improvements

Refactored code with clean architecture principles

Modernized UI with better design

Additional features for tracking and reporting
